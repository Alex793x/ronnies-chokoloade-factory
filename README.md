# ronnies-chokoloade-factory

> Verdens bedste italienske chokolade is

A Ramboll **monolith** — one repository, many services — owned by the
**Energy** department
(Adam Lagoda, Alex Holmberg, Allan Zimmermann, 7AI, Elina K.).
Generated from the Ramboll Developer Platform (Keel) `monolith-root`
golden-path blueprint — **green from birth**: the root gate and every
locally-verifiable service pass their tests on the very first commit.

_Bright ideas. Sustainable change._

## Services

| Dir | Type | Language | Path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `fe` | Frontend | react | [`services/fe/`](services/fe/) |
| `api` | Backend API | python | [`services/api/`](services/api/) |
| `dp` | Data pipeline | python | [`services/dp/`](services/dp/) |
| `inf` | Infrastructure | terraform | [`services/inf/`](services/inf/) |

The machine-readable index is [`keel.services.json`](keel.services.json) — the
single source of truth the CI resolver reads. Adding a service means adding a
directory under `services/` **and** an entry there (see
`.claude/skills/monorepo-selective-ci/SKILL.md`).

## How the smart CI works

Every push and PR runs [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml),
which starts with a **`detect`** job: it diffs the pushed range (or the PR
against its base), feeds the changed paths plus `keel.services.json` into the
pure resolver [`.github/scripts/detect_services.py`](.github/scripts/detect_services.py),
and emits the exact set of **affected services**. A change under
`services/api/` rebuilds `api` — and, transitively, every service that
`depends_on` it — while a root README edit rebuilds no service at all.

Safety is baked in rather than bolted on. A change under any shared path
(`.github/`, `keel.services.json`, `libs/` by default) rebuilds **everything**,
and whenever the diff cannot be computed (first push, force-push, resolver
error) the pipeline degrades to a **full rebuild** instead of skipping work —
the resolver is a total function that never fails the build. The **`gate`**
job always runs regardless of what changed: it executes the Hypothesis
property suite in [`tests/`](tests/) that proves the resolver's own rules
(monotonicity, isolation, closure, determinism, fallback) and validates the
manifest — so this repository continuously tests its own pipeline logic.

Affected services then fan out as a **matrix** job with per-language steps
(python: pytest/ruff/black/mypy · node/react: npm ci/test/build · go:
vet/test/build · dotnet: test · terraform: fmt/validate), each running in
`services/<dir>/`. The full contract with worked examples is in
[`docs/ci.md`](docs/ci.md).

## Branching model

This repository uses the platform's three long-lived branches:

| Branch | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `main` | Production. Protected — PR + review + green `gate` check required. |
| `dev` | Integration. PRs target this branch. |
| `staging` | Pre-production validation. |

Work happens on short-lived branches off `dev`, named **exactly**:

- `feature/<ticket>-<slug>` — new behaviour
- `bug/<ticket>-<slug>` — defect fix
- `hotfix/<ticket>-<slug>` — urgent production fix

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Standards as code — the embedded AI skills

The engineering standards are embedded as AI agent skills under `.claude/skills/`,
so any coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, …) adopts them automatically:

- [`monorepo-selective-ci`](.claude/skills/monorepo-selective-ci/SKILL.md) —
  the `keel.services.json` contract and how to add services safely.
- [`property-based-testing`](.claude/skills/property-based-testing/SKILL.md) —
  every pure function ships with Hypothesis property tests.
- [`python-clean-code`](.claude/skills/python-clean-code/SKILL.md) — small, typed,
  lint/format/type-clean functions.
- [`git-ci-governance`](.claude/skills/git-ci-governance/SKILL.md) — the branch
  model and strict naming.
