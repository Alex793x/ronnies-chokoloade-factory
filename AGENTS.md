# AGENTS.md — agent-agnostic guide for ronnies-chokoloade-factory

This file orients **any** coding agent (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Codex, Continue,
and others) working in `ronnies-chokoloade-factory`, a Ramboll **monolith** owned by the
**Energy** department
(Adam Lagoda, Alex Holmberg, Allan Zimmermann, 7AI, Elina K.). Verdens bedste italienske chokolade is

It is the vendor-neutral twin of `CLAUDE.md`; both point at the same binding
standards under `.claude/skills/`.

## Binding standards (read before editing)

The engineering rules for this repo live as skills in `.claude/skills/`. Apply
them on every change:

1. **`.claude/skills/monorepo-selective-ci/SKILL.md`** — the
   `keel.services.json` contract: every service = a `services/<dir>/` directory
   **plus** a manifest entry with honest `depends_on`; shared-path changes
   (`.github/`, `keel.services.json`, `libs/`) rebuild everything; the CI only
   rebuilds affected services.
2. **`.claude/skills/property-based-testing/SKILL.md`** — every new pure function
   ships with at least one **Hypothesis** property test (idempotency, invariants,
   round-trip, metamorphic). Treat a shrinking counterexample as a real bug.
3. **`.claude/skills/python-clean-code/SKILL.md`** — small, single-responsibility,
   **fully-typed** functions with docstrings; guard clauses; no dead code.
4. **`.claude/skills/git-ci-governance/SKILL.md`** — `main`/`dev`/`staging`;
   branches named **exactly** `feature/<ticket>-<slug>`, `bug/<ticket>-<slug>`, or
   `hotfix/<ticket>-<slug>`; Conventional Commits; PRs into `dev` with review +
   CODEOWNERS + a green `gate` check.

## Services in this monolith

| Dir | Type | Language |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `services/fe/` | Frontend | react |
| `services/api/` | Backend API | python |
| `services/dp/` | Data pipeline | python |
| `services/inf/` | Infrastructure | terraform |

The CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) resolves every change against
`keel.services.json` via `.github/scripts/detect_services.py` and rebuilds only
the affected services (plus their transitive dependents).

## Commands (root gate)

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest                # resolver property tests — the always-on `gate` job

# Dry-run the resolver against your working set:
git diff --name-only dev...HEAD | python .github/scripts/detect_services.py \
  --manifest keel.services.json --changed -
```

## Non-negotiables (summary)

- New/changed service ⇒ keep `keel.services.json` in sync (dir + `depends_on`).
- Never weaken the resolver's safe fallbacks (empty diff ⇒ ALL; error ⇒ ALL).
- New pure function ⇒ at least one property test; keep the gate green.
- Respect the branch model and naming; PRs go into `dev`.
