# CLAUDE.md — agent guide for ronnies-chokoloade-factory

This file orients **Claude Code** (and any Claude-based coding agent) working in
`ronnies-chokoloade-factory`, a Ramboll **monolith** owned by the
**Energy** department
(Adam Lagoda, Alex Holmberg, Allan Zimmermann, 7AI, Elina K.). Verdens bedste italienske chokolade is

## Read these skills first — they are binding

The engineering standards for this repo are encoded as skills under
`.claude/skills/`. **Adopt them on every change:**

1. **[`monorepo-selective-ci`](.claude/skills/monorepo-selective-ci/SKILL.md)** —
   the `keel.services.json` contract: every service = a `services/<dir>/`
   directory **plus** a manifest entry (with honest `depends_on`); shared-path
   changes (`.github/`, `keel.services.json`, `libs/`) rebuild everything.
2. **[`property-based-testing`](.claude/skills/property-based-testing/SKILL.md)** —
   every new pure function ships with at least one **Hypothesis** property test
   (idempotency, invariants, round-trip, metamorphic). A shrinking counterexample
   is a real bug.
3. **[`python-clean-code`](.claude/skills/python-clean-code/SKILL.md)** — small,
   single-responsibility, **fully-typed** functions with docstrings; guard clauses;
   no dead code.
4. **[`git-ci-governance`](.claude/skills/git-ci-governance/SKILL.md)** —
   `main`/`dev`/`staging`; branches named **exactly** `feature/<ticket>-<slug>`,
   `bug/<ticket>-<slug>`, or `hotfix/<ticket>-<slug>`; Conventional Commits; PRs
   into `dev` with review + CODEOWNERS + a green `gate` check.

## Services in this monolith

| Dir | Type | Language |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `services/fe/` | Frontend | react |
| `services/api/` | Backend API | python |
| `services/dp/` | Data pipeline | python |
| `services/inf/` | Infrastructure | terraform |

Each service keeps its own toolchain and tests inside its directory. The CI
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) only rebuilds the services your change affects —
resolved by `.github/scripts/detect_services.py` against `keel.services.json`.

## Project layout

```
services/<dir>/           # one directory per service (see the table above)
keel.services.json        # machine-readable service index — CI's source of truth
.github/scripts/          # detect_services.py — the pure selective-CI resolver
.github/workflows/ci.yml  # detect → gate → affected-services matrix
tests/                    # Hypothesis property suite for the resolver (the gate)
docs/                     # service index + how the smart CI works
```

## Local commands (root gate)

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest                # resolver property tests — the always-on `gate` job

# Dry-run the resolver against your working set:
git diff --name-only dev...HEAD | python .github/scripts/detect_services.py \
  --manifest keel.services.json --changed -
```

## Non-negotiables (summary)

- New/changed service ⇒ keep `keel.services.json` in sync (dir + `depends_on`).
- Never weaken the resolver's safe fallbacks (empty diff ⇒ ALL; error ⇒ ALL).
- New pure function ⇒ at least one property test; keep the gate green.
- Respect the branch model and naming; PRs go into `dev`.

When in doubt, open the relevant `SKILL.md` and follow it.
